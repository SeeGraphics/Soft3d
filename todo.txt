- try and make drawing shapes easier, propably in normalized space.

- go 3D so add projection matrix and transformations. 
GOAL: get a square / pane to render in 3D space with camera movement. 

- once the basic functionality is in place, think and plan about the 
structure of the engine / future library.
- and give it a name for the repo as well. 

-> then: 
- refine structure, e.g seperation of code into files, file structure, 
small main loop, streamline shape creation, vertexes etc..., add more functions to simplify that
- so engine.c propably?
